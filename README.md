# Stellar-Invasion
A small game created in the Processing development environment in my first year of university. This was meant as a supplementary project for the programming exams given at the end of the first semester.

Although used primarilly for a programming exam, this served as a strong foundation for all future code work as it helped teach and enforce general coding convention.
